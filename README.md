## About Me

My name is Tozammel Hossain. I am a postdoctoral research associate at the University of Southern California - [Information Sciences Institue (ISI)](https://www.isi.edu/). I earned my doctoral degree in computer science at [Virginia Tech]().<!---, where I worked under the supervision of [Dr. Naren Ramakrishnan](http://people.cs.vt.edu/~ramakris/) at [Discovery Analytics Center](https://dac.cs.vt.edu/). --->  

My research interests broadly lie in developing and applying data mining and machine learning techniques to solve problems stemming from bioinformatics, social networks, and social science. I enjoy working at the boundaries between the data science and domain sciences. Some of my recent research address problems of inferring coevolving entities with interaction structure in complex systems, forecasting societal population-level events (like flu outbreak and hashtag propagation), and modeling behavior, such as prejudice and ideological leanings, in social systems.    

My career goal is to solve challenging problems in the area of data mining and machine learning.

## Education

### Virginia Tech

I earned my doctoral degree in the Department of Computer Science at Virginia Tech. I performed my research in the Discovery Analytics Center led by Dr. Naren Ramakrishnan. My thesis was in the area of bioinformatics, specifically on modeling evolutionary constraints and improving multiple sequence alignments using couplings. I received a masters degree from the same department in 2014.

<!---I am pursuing a doctoral degree in the Department of Computer Science at Virginia Tech. I am working in the Discovery Analytics Center led by Dr. Naren Ramakrishnan. I plan to finish my doctoral degree by Jul 2016. My thesis is Couplings for Modeling Evolutionary Constraints and Improving Multiple Sequence Alignments. I received a masters degree from the same department in 2014.  Currently, I am working on the projects Protein Constraints Modeling, Social Network Sensors, and Supreme Court Ideal Points Miner. I also worked on other projects: Hidden Topic Ailment State Model and Feature Selection in Rank-Order Space. During my course of Ph.D. study, I took courses in the area of machine learning, data mining, statistics, and bioinformatics. --->

### Bangladesh University of Engineering & Technology

I obtained my B.Sc. degree in Computer Science & Engineering in the Department of CSE at Bangladesh University of Engineering & Technology in 2007. I conducted my undergraduate thesis under the supervision of Dr. Saidur Rahman, and my topic was Applications of Graphs in Bioinformatics.

### Research 
Some of the selected projects that I am either working or had been working on is listed below. 

#### Modeling Evolutionary Constraints in Proteins
This project aims to model evolutionary constraints in proteins. Evolutionary constraints shape the sequences, structures, and functions of protein families. We are interested in a type of evolutionary constraint, residue coupling or correlated mutation, which is an important indicator for predicting protein structures and revealing functional insights into proteins. We are focusing on modeling rich set of residue couplings, both pairwise and higher-order, with an emphasis on providing a mechanistic explanation for couplings and decomposing couplings of various orders. We also investigate a method for mining frequent episodes, called coupled patterns, in an alignment produced by a classical algorithm for both proteins and RNAs, and for exploiting the coupled patterns for improving the alignment quality concerning exposition of couplings. NSF supports this project with a proposal—Integration, Prediction, and Generation of Mixed Mode Information. This proposal is a collaboration between Carnegie Mellon University, Dartmouth College, Purdue University, and PNNL. 

#### Modeling Ailment State of Users using Social Network Data
Contagions arise in many situations—biological (like Flu), social (memes, hashtag propagating on twitter), etc. While epidemiological research has inspired researchers modeling social contagion, recent work has shown that there are key aspects along which social contagions differ from biological contagions. In this project, we reconcile the apparently contrasting behaviors with a finer-grained modeling of biological phases as inferred from tweets. We propose a temporal topic model for inferring hidden biological states for users. Our work can be seen as a stepping stone to a better understanding of contagions that occur in both biological and social spheres.

#### Designing Social Network Sensors for Epidemics
Early detection and modeling of a contagious epidemic can provide important guidance about quelling the contagion, controlling its spread, or the effective design of countermeasures. The goal of this project is to design social network sensors—a small set of people who can be monitored to provide insight into the emergence of an epidemic in a larger population. Using the graph theoretic notion of dominators we develop an efficient and effective heuristic for lead-time detection. Using city-scale datasets generated by extensive microscopic epidemiological simulations involving millions of individuals, we illustrate the practical applicability of our methods and show significant benefits (up to 22 days more lead time) compared to other competitors.

#### Inferring Ideal Points for US Supreme Court Justices
In Supreme Court parlance and the political science literature, an ideal point positions a justice in a continuous space and can be interpreted as a quantification of the justices policy preferences. We present an automated approach to infer such ideal points for justices of the US Supreme Court. This approach combines topic modeling over case opinions with the voting (and endorsing) behavior of justices. Furthermore, given a topic of interest, say the Fourth Amendment, the topic model can be optionally seeded with supervised information to steer the inference of ideal points. Application of this methodology to five years of cases provides interesting perspectives into the leaning of justices on crucial issues, coalitions underlying specific topics, and the role of swing justices in deciding the outcomes of cases.

#### Feature Selection in Rank-Order Spaces
In some important financial and scientific domains, features are best interpreted via ordinal comparisons with other features, rather than as absolute values. For example, biological cells go through various phases, and abundant of cell products may vary or remain constant in these cycles. It is more realistic to compare the abundant of cell products in terms of their ranks. We propose algorithms for extracting temporal signatures from multi-variate time series data, where the signatures are composed of ordinal comparisons between time series components.

#### Computational Modeling of Gene Silencing
I worked on the project Computational Modeling of Gene Silencing for one year (Aug 2009 to Jun 2010). The goal of the project was to construct models of the gene silencing phenomenon for the microscopic worm Caenorhabditis Elegans. My responsibility was to improve the data integration and annotation part of the model. Moreover, I performed data analysis by applying compositional data mining, a new tool developed in the computer science department, to retrieve interesting and informative patterns from the data. This project had been running for six years and ended successfully on June 2010. This Dr. Lenwood S. Heath and Dr. Naren Ramakrishnan supervised me for this project.
