## Welcome

My name is Tozammel Hossain. I am a postdoctoral research associate at the University of Southern California - [Information Sciences Institue (ISI)](https://www.isi.edu/). I earned my doctoral degree in the Department of Computer Science at [Virginia Tech](), where I worked under the supervision of [Dr. Naren Ramakrishnan](http://people.cs.vt.edu/~ramakris/) at [Discovery Analytics Center](https://dac.cs.vt.edu/).  

My research interests broadly lie in developing and applying data mining and machine learning techniques to solve problems stemming from bioinformatics, social networks, and social science. I enjoy working at the boundaries between the data science and domain sciences. Some of my recent research address problems of inferring coevolving entities with interaction structure in complex systems, forecasting societal population-level events (like flu outbreak and hashtag propagation), and modeling behavior, such as prejudice and ideological leanings, in social systems.    

My career goal is to solve challenging problems in the area of data mining and machine learning.

## Education

### Virginia Tech

I am pursuing a doctoral degree in the Department of Computer Science at Virginia Tech. I am working in the Discovery Analytics Center led by Dr. Naren Ramakrishnan. I plan to finish my doctoral degree by Jul 2016. My thesis is Couplings for Modeling Evolutionary Constraints and Improving Multiple Sequence Alignments. I received a masters degree from the same department in 2014.  Currently, I am working on the projects Protein Constraints Modeling, Social Network Sensors, and Supreme Court Ideal Points Miner. I also worked on other projects: Hidden Topic Ailment State Model and Feature Selection in Rank-Order Space. During my course of Ph.D. study, I took courses in the area of machine learning, data mining, statistics, and bioinformatics.

### Bangladesh University of Engineering & Technology

I obtained my B.Sc. degree in Computer Science & Engineering in the Department of CSE at Bangladesh University of Engineering & Technology in 2007. I conducted my undergraduate thesis under the supervision of Dr. Saidur Rahman, and my topic was Applications of Graphs in Bioinformatics.
