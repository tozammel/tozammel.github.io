## Welcome

My name is Tozammel Hossain. I am a postdoctoral research associate at the University of Southern California - [Information Sciences Institue (ISI)](https://www.isi.edu/). I earned my doctoral degree in the Department of Computer Science at [Virginia Tech](), where I worked under the supervision of [Dr. Naren Ramakrishnan](http://people.cs.vt.edu/~ramakris/) at [Discovery Analytics Center](https://dac.cs.vt.edu/).  

My research interests broadly lie in developing and applying data mining and machine learning techniques to solve problems stemming from bioinformatics, social networks, and social science. I enjoy working at the boundaries between the data science and domain sciences. Some of my recent research address problems of inferring coevolving entities with interaction structure in complex systems, forecasting societal population-level events (like flu outbreak and hashtag propagation), and modeling behavior, such as prejudice and ideological leanings, in social systems.    

My career goal is to solve challenging problems in the area of data mining and machine learning.
