## About Me

My name is Tozammel Hossain. I am currently an assistant professor in the Department of Information Science at the University of North Texas. Previously, I was an assistant research professor at the University of Missouri - Institute for Data Science and Informatics. I received my PhD in computer science at Virginia Tech and earned three years of experience as a postdoctoral associate at the University of Southern California-Information Sciences Institute (USC-ISI).

<!---I am an Assitant Research Professor at the Unversity of Missour-Institute for Data Science and Informatics. EarlI am a postdoctoral research associate at the University of Southern California - [Information Sciences Institue (ISI)](https://www.isi.edu/). I earned my doctoral degree in computer science at [Virginia Tech]().<!---, where I worked under the supervision of [Dr. Naren Ramakrishnan](http://people.cs.vt.edu/~ramakris/) at [Discovery Analytics Center](https://dac.cs.vt.edu/). --->  

<!---My research interests broadly lie in developing and applying data mining and machine learning techniques to solve problems stemming from bioinformatics, social networks, social science, and cyber security. I enjoy working at the boundaries between the data science and domain sciences. Some of my recent research addresses problems of inferring coevolving entities with interaction structure in complex systems, forecasting societal population and/or enterprise level events (like flu outbreak, military/non-state actor events, and malicious cyber activities), and modeling behavior, such as prejudice and ideological leanings, in social systems.--->  

My research interests lie in applied machine learning and data science, with an emphasis on bioinformatics, health informatics, social science, and cybersecurity. Some of my recent research include devising methods for anticipating societal population-level events (e.g., flu outbreak and civil unrest), disease incidence, and cyber-attacks; inferring co-evolving entities and their interactions in complex systems; and modeling state and behavior in social systems (e.g., ideological leanings, polarization, and equity). 

My career goal is to solve challenging problems in machine learning and data science.

### Research Projects
Below are some of the selected projects I am working on or have previously worked on. 

#### Modeling Evolutionary Constraints in Proteins
This project aims to model evolutionary constraints in proteins. Evolutionary constraints shape the sequences, structures, and functions of protein families. We are interested in a type of evolutionary constraint, residue coupling, or correlated mutation, an important indicator for predicting protein structures and revealing functional insights into proteins. We are focusing on modeling a rich set of pairwise and higher-order residue couplings, emphasizing providing a mechanistic explanation for couplings and decomposing couplings of various orders. We also investigate a method for mining frequent episodes, called coupled patterns, in an alignment produced by a classical algorithm for proteins and RNAs. We also exploit the coupled patterns to improve the alignment quality concerning the exposition of couplings. NSF supports this project with a proposal for integrating, predicting, and generating mixed-mode information. This proposal is a collaboration between Carnegie Mellon University, Dartmouth College, Purdue University, and PNNL. 

#### Modeling Ailment State of Users using Social Network Data
Contagions arise in many situations, such as biological (like Flu), social (memes, hashtag propagating on Twitter), etc. While epidemiological research has inspired researchers modeling social contagion, recent work has shown that there are key aspects along which social contagions differ from biological contagions. In this project, we reconcile the apparently contrasting behaviors with finer-grained modeling of biological phases as inferred from tweets. We propose a temporal topic model for inferring hidden biological states for users. Our work can be seen as a stepping stone to a better understanding of contagions in both biological and social spheres.

#### Designing Social Network Sensors for Epidemics
Early detection and modeling of a contagious epidemic can provide important guidance about quelling the contagion, controlling its spread, or the effective design of countermeasures. This project aims to design social network sensors—a small set of people who can be monitored to provide insight into the emergence of an epidemic in a larger population. Using the graph-theoretic notion of dominators, we develop an efficient and effective heuristic for lead-time detection. Using city-scale datasets generated by extensive microscopic epidemiological simulations involving millions of individuals, we illustrate the practical applicability of our methods and show significant benefits (up to 22 days more lead time) compared to other competitors.

#### Inferring Ideal Points for US Supreme Court Justices
In Supreme Court parlance and the political science literature, an ideal point positions a justice in a continuous space. It can be interpreted as a quantification of the justice policy preferences. We present an automated approach to infer such ideal points for justices of the US Supreme Court. This approach combines topic modeling over case opinions with judges' voting (and endorsing) behavior. Furthermore, given a topic of interest, say the Fourth Amendment, the topic model can be optionally seeded with supervised information to steer the inference of ideal points. Applying this methodology to five years of cases provides exciting perspectives into the leaning of justices on crucial issues, coalitions underlying specific topics, and the role of swing justices in deciding the outcomes of cases.

#### Feature Selection in Rank-Order Spaces
In some important financial and scientific domains, features are best interpreted via ordinal comparisons with other features rather than as absolute values. For example, biological cells go through various phases, and abundant of cell products may vary or remain constant in these cycles. It is more realistic to compare the abundance of cell products in terms of their ranks. We propose algorithms for extracting temporal signatures from multi-variate time series data, where the signatures are composed of ordinal comparisons between time series components.

#### Computational Modeling of Gene Silencing
I worked on the project Computational Modeling of Gene Silencing for one year (Aug 2009 to Jun 2010). The project aimed to construct models of the gene silencing phenomenon for the microscopic worm Caenorhabditis Elegans. My responsibility was to improve the data integration and annotation part of the model. Moreover, I performed data analysis by applying compositional data mining, a new tool developed in the computer science department, to retrieve interesting and informative patterns from the data. This project had been running for six years and ended successfully on June 2010. This Dr. Lenwood S. Heath and Dr. Naren Ramakrishnan supervised me for this project.
